###Dice_Roll2.1.py

This is a simple dice rolling program I made for fun. Written in python specifically for python 3 (python 2 doesn't work).

###Known issues
+ Supports Python 3 (due to use of 'input()' instead of 'raw_input()')
+ If a non-integer is passed to change the number of sides, the program quits and raises a 'ValueError'.

### To-Do
+ Implement a check to prevent non-integer value from being set as the dice-side value
+ Support for python 2
